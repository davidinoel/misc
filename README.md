An archive of files, the majority of which I've writen in the past six months or so.

They're broken down into:
* ./bugs: containing bug reports and substantial issues in various software projects I use or have used...
* ./feature-requests: useful additions to existing projects that I use or have used, and...
* ./projects-freebies: a list of useful software projects I probably won't have time to ever build myself that I figure it's time I make public in case someone else does have the time to bring them to life.

There may be some overlap (in feature-requests and projects-freebies, for example), so the directory structure may change at some point in the future.

Consider these released under the "Non-Commercial Flexitarian License". If you are involved in any of these projects, related ones, or wish to develop any of the projects I've described and have issues with the licensing, please contact me at my username at gmail.

I'm always looking for business partners to assist in building out my never-ending list of projects, so if anything you find here strikes you as a fairly good idea--keeping in mind that these are the freebies I'm giving out publicly--and you have any interest in more profitable projects, please feel free to get in touch. I also freelance, have experience in most areas of business, and am open to remote consulting opportunities.
