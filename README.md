Broken down into: ./bugs (bug reports and substantial issues in various software projects I use or have used), ./feature-requests (useful additions to existing projects that I use or have used), ./projects-freebies (a list of useful software projects I probably won't have time to ever build myself that I figure it's time I make public in case someone else does have the time to bring them to life).
