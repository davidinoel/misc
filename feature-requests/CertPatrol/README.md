##CertPatrol

*Feature:* Add an option to save rejected certs for sites, so we don't have to continue rejecting the same cert over and over.

*Nuisance:* Either give users the option to enable/disable it, or stop forcing the focus of the browser to the window where cert patrol has popped-up a warning.

For example, when the browser is restarted and the tabs are re-loaded, Cert Patrol forces focus on tabs where alerts are thrown. Users can address each alert when they switch focus to that tab as it is needed--the browser doesn't have to force the focus there. It's a UX nightmare to have tabs auto-switching/forcing-focus without user consent, or at least without allowing them to toggle it off.
