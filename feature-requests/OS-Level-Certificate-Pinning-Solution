Cert Patrol is a great browser extension that fills the gap between the current tools available in Operating Systems and web browsers to ensure the integrity of TLS connections  being made. Unfortunately, the web browser isn't the only application making use of TLS within the Operating System.

If browsers are vulnerable to attacks without this sort of solution, how can applications,  or Operating Systems, rely on TLS and its related infrastructure without making themselves vulnerable to this sort of attack as well?

While many languages include the features to support Pinning functionality, not all applications go to the extent of implementing them. For those applications and those connections, a Cert Patrol-like application or Pinning daemon is the only way to avoid those types of attacks.
