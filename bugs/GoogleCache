Background:
There seems to be a prevalent myth that using Google's cache is an anonymous means of accessing the content of page on a particular website (anonymous to the end-server).

Google Cache has three options: "Full version", "Text-only version", and "View source". By default however, Google has the Cache set to "Full version" with no way of setting the preference otherwise ahead of time.


Problem:
By default, when you access Google Cache--via Google's web interface for example, by clicking the downward arrow next to a URL and selecting to view the cached copy of it, you'll still hit the server you're requesting the cached document of and leak your IP to it. Users will also be exposed via DNS query, as hitting the site requires a translation via DNS to IP address.

This is due to the the Cache's default setting--which can't be configured elsewhere--of auto-loading the "Full version" of the website, and the fact that Google does not cache entire copies of website content. When you access the Cache on this "Full version" setting, it instructs your browser to make requests to the server to load the remaining objects that Google does not cache, such as images.


Short-term Work-arounds (the Quick Fixes):
- If you want the "Text-only version" of the site (anonymous to the end-host), append: "&strip=1" to the Cache URL prior to accessing it.
- If you want the "View source" version, append: "&vwsrc=1".
- Use a more "anonymous-by-default" alternative caching website.

Mid-term Work-arounds:
- A browser extension that allows users to select the version of the cache that they wish to access, intercepts requests to the cache, and appends the appropriate suffix to the URL before sending it outbound.
- For safety, defaulting to either of the anonymous versions and allowing the user to select the "Full version" if so desired.

Long-term Work-arounds:
- Google adding this feature to allow users to pre-select the version of the cache that they desired.
- If you know any Google employees, talk to them about the problem, and see if you can get any internal advocates to champion and drive forward the project.
